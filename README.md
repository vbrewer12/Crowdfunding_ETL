## Overview
-----------
This group project involves Extracting, Transforming and Loading two files into a Crowdfunding database.
 Files Used:
 * crowdfunding.csv
 * contacts.csv
## Technologies Used
--------------------
 * Jupyter Notebook
 * Python
 * Pandas
 * Numpy
 * Datetime
 * QuickDBD
# Objective
1. Extract
    - In Jupyter import the pandas, numpy and DateTime libraries. Once that is done we imported the crowdfunding and contact csv files.
3. Transform
   - We started by separating the category and sub category column into two separate columns and adding index numbers.
   - With the campaign dataframe we renamed columns to align with our goal and merged in the category and subcat dataframe
   - Lastly we merged the contacts into the dataframe
5. Load
    - We extracted the dataframes into a csv file
We then created a database
