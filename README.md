# Objective
1. Extract
    - In Jupyter import the pandas, numpy and DateTime libraries. Once that is done we imported the crowdfunding and contact csv files.
3. Transform
   - We started by separating the category and sub category column into two separate columns and adding index numbers.
   - With the campaign dataframe we renamed columns to align with our goal and merged in the category and subcat dataframe
   - Lastly we merged the contacts into the dataframe
5. Load
    - We extracted the dataframes into a csv file
We then created a database
